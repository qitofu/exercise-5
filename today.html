            <h1>The Mythical Nandi Bear â€“ Eyewitness Reports</h1>
            <h2><Feb 1, 2023</h2>
            <p>
               This mythical creature was named the Nandi bear by Europeans 
               because accounts of its existence came mainly from the Nandi people (part of the Kalenjin).
               Early reports by Europeans describe a bearlike creature. I heard of a skin in Kabras and 
               tried very hard to obtain it; but could not do so. The Nandi say that they once killed one 
               years ago owing to its having climbed upon the roof of a hut and broken through. 
               It killed the people inside the hut, but others burnt the place down with the animal inside.  
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>They say the reason it is never killed is because it is entirely nocturnal, it is very rare, 
               and only attacks solitary people, who never return to tell the tale. </strong>
